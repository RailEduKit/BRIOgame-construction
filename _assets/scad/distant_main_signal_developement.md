**message:** new scad for distant-main_signal

**id:** 86ad868b4a1d5f8c6394f25796be168684d56a8c

![](_assets/scad/pictures_distant_main_signal_developement/signal-26_11_24_1.png)

**pro**

control is easy to move

**con**

cover to height -> it was difficult to get the cotrol in the cover

conecting pins broke instantly, connecting hole was not closed at the outer wall

## 26.11.2024

**message:** new pins and first barrier try to lock the signal

**pro**

thiner cover height -> it was easier to get the control in the cover

new pins don't break and they hold the cover

first mechanism to lock a position: wall in the middle -> bottom of control has a wider and smaller side

**con**

the sides with no pins don't close completly

the pins need glue to hold the cover permanently

because of the barrier, the frame has to be wider.

> To see through the cover, the hole signal has to be wider

To print the overhang of the control it has to be supported. The support wasn't completly removed -> the control is heavy to move

it is difficult to turn the control to lock it

## 28.11.2024

**message:** connecting parts on all four sites
handle for easier use

**pro**

the pins are higher an on all 4 sides -> the cover holds without glue and on all sides (nice click moment)

handle to turn move and turn the control

**con**

thicker wall to have holes for the pins and later the magnets

> wider frame

## 02.12.2024

**message:** changed cylinder cotrol in cube control
changed screwcap in plugcap

**id:** 1de874341730003b708cb8dd33249337fa088960

![](_assets\scad\pictures_distant_main_signal_developement\signal-02_12_24.png)

**pro**

nice movement of the control

lock pin works

get control in cover is easy

**con**

control doesn't end with the cover at the small side

the overhang of the control needs support during the print -> it is timeconsuming to  remove this support for every control -> **choose tree support in slim or strong** 

the cover doesn't close completly with the body, because of the new positions of the pins

## 03.12.2024

**message:** new connecting pin arrangement
stopper to lock signal

**id:** ef44d4da6de4a39fd91604b97119a3d5eb68b354

![](_assets/scad/pictures_distant_main_signal_developement/signal-28_11_24.png)

**pro**

good connection between cover and body

**con**

thick bottom of body

stopper to short

locker pin hole need more tolerance

locker passage should be a bit higher, in cas the support isn't removed completly

## 03.12.2024

**message:** stopper bugfix and add color_blocks

**id:** e0ca36c64b771dc1bb573b2d670455153cdbacb2

![](_assets/scad/pictures_distant_main_signal_developement/signal-28_11_24.png)

**pro**

first time that the signal has colors

stopper is long enough and fits in the hole

**con**

shadow from frame overhang (cover) on signal color

> solution: no overhang on the small side
> 
> thus, the lock can be placed higher, the control bottom can be thinner, the signal color is closer to the top and better visible

locker sits too losse

absence of the main and distant signal symbol 

it is difficult to set the stopper at its place

## 05.12.2024

**message:** signal colors closer to the top, less covered
stopper higher, handle, square pin
main, distant signal symbol

**id:** 2522d5dc80fd64cf86d9c238494ddce42f65e868

![]()

**pro**

more view on the colors, no overhang on the short sites

main/ distant symbol

stable stopper

**con**

the connecting pins of the colors break to often -> two connecting pins prevent wobble

handle of stopper to thick -> really helpful? -> turn 90Â°

control bottom h thinner -> colors nearer to the top, but locker has to be higher -> it needs also space in the cover -> the cover is less stable

the connecting pins doesn't fit perfect sometimes -> hole tolerance
