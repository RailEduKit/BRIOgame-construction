**pro**

control is easy to move

**con**

cover to height -> it was difficult to get the cotrol in the cover

conecting pins broke instantly, connecting hole was not closed at the outer wall

**pro**

thiner cover height -> it was easier to get the control in the cover

new pins don't break and they hold the cover

first mechanism to lock a position: wall in the middle -> bottom of control has a wider and smaller side

**con**

the sides with no pins don't close completly

the pins need glue to hold the cover permanently

because of the barrier, the frame has to be wider.

> To see through the cover, the hole signal has to be wider

To print the overhang of the control it has to be supported. The support wasn't completly removed -> the control is heavy to move

it is difficult to turn the control to lock it

**pro**

the pins are higher an on all 4 sides -> the cover holds without glue and on all sides (nice click moment)

handle to turn move and turn the control

**con**

thicker wall to have holes for the pins and later the magnets

> wider frame

## 02.12.2024

**message:** changed cylinder cotrol in cube control
changed screwcap in plugcap

**id:** 1de874341730003b708cb8dd33249337fa088960

**pro**

nice movement of the control

lock pin works

get control in cover is easy

**con**

control doesn't end with the cover at the small side

the overhang of the control needs support during the print -> it is timeconsuming to  remove this support for every control -> **choose tree support in slim or strong** 

the cover doesn't close completly with the body, because of the new positions of the pins



## 03.12.2024

**message:** new connecting pin arrangement
stopper to lock signal

**id:** ef44d4da6de4a39fd91604b97119a3d5eb68b354

![](_assets/scad/pictures_distant_main_signal_developement/signal-28_11_24.png)

**pro**

good connection between cover and body

**con**

thick bottom of body

stopper to short

locker pin hole need more tolerance

locker passage should be a bit higher, in cas the support isn't removed completly
