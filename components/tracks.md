# Track Components

The track system is the foundation of the SigLab, providing the physical infrastructure for train movement and signal placement.

## Track Types

### Straight Tracks
* Standard length: 100mm
* Used for main line sections
* Contains magnet positions for train movement
* Can be connected end-to-end for longer sections

### Curved Tracks
* Radius: 200mm
* Angle: 45° or 90° sections
* Used for turns and junctions
* Contains magnet positions for smooth train movement

### Switch Tracks
* Allows trains to change tracks
* Contains moving switch blade
* Includes locking mechanism
* Can be set to different routes

## Track Components

### Base Structure
* Wooden base with drilled holes
* Magnet rods inserted in holes
* Smooth surface for train movement
* Proper alignment for continuous operation

### Magnet System
* Round magnet rods for straight sections
* Oval magnet rods for curved sections
* Proper spacing for train movement
* Strong enough for reliable operation

### Connection System
* Magnetic coupling between sections
* Proper alignment guides
* Secure connection mechanism
* Easy disassembly for storage

## Track Layout

### Basic Layout
* Main line with passing loops
* Station areas
* Junction points
* Signal positions

### Advanced Layout
* Multiple parallel tracks
* Complex junctions
* Station platforms
* Maintenance areas

## Track Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance
* Clean track surface
* Check magnet strength
* Verify alignment
* Test connections

### Troubleshooting
* Loose connections
* Weak magnets
* Misaligned sections
* Rough movement

## Track Safety

### Design Features
* Smooth edges
* Proper spacing
* Secure connections
* Clear markings

### Usage Guidelines
* Proper handling
* Storage recommendations
* Cleaning procedures
* Safety precautions

## Track Accessories

### Markers
* Station markers
* Speed limit signs
* Direction indicators
* Distance markers

### Supports
* Track risers
* Bridge supports
* Tunnel entrances
* Station platforms

## Track Planning

### Layout Design
* Consider available space
* Plan for expansion
* Include maintenance access
* Account for signal placement

### Component Requirements
* Track sections needed
* Switch requirements
* Signal positions
* Accessory placement
