# Signal Components

The signalling system is a crucial part of the SigLab, providing visual indicators for train movement control and safety.

## Signal Types

### Main Signals
* Primary control signals
* Three-aspect display (red, yellow, green)
* Located at block boundaries
* Controls train movement

### Distant Signals
* Warning signals
* Two-aspect display (yellow, green)
* Located before main signals
* Provides advance warning

### Route Signals
* Junction control signals
* Multiple aspects
* Located at switches
* Controls route selection

## Signal Components

### Signal Bodies
* Main signal body
* Distant signal body
* Route signal body
* Mounting mechanism

### Color Blocks
* Main signal aspects
* Distant signal aspects
* Route signal aspects
* Movement mechanism

### Clearing Points
* Route clearing indicators
* Block boundary markers
* Movement indicators
* Position markers

## Signal Operation

### Basic Operation
* Aspect changes
* Route indication
* Clearing point movement
* Signal sequencing

### Control Mechanism
* Manual operation
