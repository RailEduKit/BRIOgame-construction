# About the Interactive Signalling Laboratory

The Interactive Signalling Laboratory (SigLab) is an innovative educational tool designed to teach railway signalling concepts through hands-on experience. It combines the engaging nature of board games with practical learning of railway operations and safety principles.

## Purpose

The SigLab was developed to address several key educational needs:

* Provide a tangible way to understand abstract railway signalling concepts
* Enable safe experimentation with signalling scenarios
* Create an engaging learning environment through gameplay
* Facilitate understanding of railway safety principles
* Bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application

## Concept

The SigLab is inspired by traditional wooden toy trains (like BRIO) but enhanced with educational features:

* **Discrete Movement**: Trains move in discrete steps, making it easier to understand timing and spacing
* **Physics Simulation**: Speed, time, and velocity are represented as discrete values
* **Interactive Elements**: Participants use tokens to control and interact with the system
* **Cooperative Gameplay**: Players work together to ensure safe and efficient train operations
* **Progressive Learning**: The system allows for increasingly complex scenarios

## Educational Value

The SigLab serves multiple educational purposes:

1. **Understanding Signalling**: Learn how signals control train movements
2. **Safety Principles**: Experience the importance of safety in railway operations
3. **System Thinking**: Develop an understanding of how different components interact
4. **Problem Solving**: Practice resolving operational challenges
5. **Team Collaboration**: Work together to manage railway operations

## Versions

The SigLab is available in two versions:

1. **Paper Prototype**
   * Quick to build and iterate
   * Ideal for testing concepts
   * Low-cost materials
   * Perfect for educational institutions

2. **Wooden Version**
   * Durable and long-lasting
   * Professional appearance
   * Suitable for permanent installations
   * Ideal for training centers

## Target Audience

The SigLab is designed for:

* Railway engineering students
* Signalling professionals
* Educational institutions
* Railway museums
* Training centers
* Railway enthusiasts
