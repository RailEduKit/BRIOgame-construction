# Instruction Main Signal

The main signal consists of two parts - color\_block and signal\_body, which are connected with a brass rod. 
The signal term can be changed by flipping the color\_block. The red signal term can be locked with a [Locking Pin](/instruction_for_components/construction-locking_pin/).
The magnets on the side attach the signal to the track. The body has magnets on both sides to attach several components at one place.
