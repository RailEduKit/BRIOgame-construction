**pro**

thiner cover height -> it was easier to get the control in the cover

new pins don't break and they hold the cover

first mechanism to lock a position: wall in the middle -> bottom of control has a wider and smaller side

**con**

the sides with no pins don't close completly

the pins need glue to hold the cover permanently

because of the barrier, the frame has to be wider.

> To see through the cover, the hole signal has to be wider

To print the overhang of the control it has to be supported. The support wasn't completly removed -> the control is heavy to move

it is difficult to turn the control to lock it

**pro**

the pins are higher an on all 4 sides -> the cover holds without glue and on all sides (nice click moment)

handle to turn move and turn the control

**con**

thicker wall to have holes for the pins and later the magnets

> wider frame
