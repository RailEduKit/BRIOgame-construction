# SigLab Assembly Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for assembling your SigLab components. Follow these instructions carefully to ensure proper functionality.

## Prerequisites

Before starting assembly:
1. Ensure all 3D printed components are ready (see [3D Printing Guide](3d-printing.md))
2. Gather all required materials (see [Materials List](materials.md))
3. Prepare your workspace with adequate lighting and tools

## Base Construction

### 1. Track Base Assembly

1. Start with the wooden base board
2. Use the drill templates to mark hole positions:
   * Place `drill_template_straight.stl` for straight sections
   * Use `drill_template_curve.stl` for curved sections
   * Position `drill_template_switch.stl` for switch locations
3. Drill holes according to template markings
4. Insert magnet rods into drilled holes
5. Secure with adhesive if necessary

### 2. Signal Installation

1. Assemble signal bodies:
   * Insert color blocks into signal bodies
   * Attach route indicators where needed
   * Install clearing point markers
2. Position signals along the track:
   * Main signals at block boundaries
   * Distant signals at appropriate distances
   * Route signals at junction points
3. Secure signals to the base

### 3. Switch Mechanism Assembly

1. Install switch blades:
   * Position blade mechanism
   * Attach locking pins
   * Test movement and locking
2. Connect control mechanisms
3. Verify smooth operation

### 4. Train Assembly

1. Assemble train components:
   * Attach headlight coupler to front
   * Install tail coupler at rear
   * Add headlight and tail symbols
2. Test train movement on tracks
3. Verify magnetic coupling

## Quality Checks

After assembly, verify:

1. Track Alignment
   * All sections align properly
   * No gaps between sections
   * Smooth transitions at curves

2. Signal Functionality
   * Color blocks move freely
   * Route indicators work properly
   * Clearing points are visible

3. Switch Operation
   * Blades move smoothly
   * Locking mechanism works
   * No binding or sticking

4. Train Movement
   * Smooth rolling on all track sections
   * Proper magnetic coupling
   * No derailments

## Final Steps

1. Clean the assembly
2. Apply any final finishes
3. Test the complete system
4. Document any adjustments needed

## Maintenance

Regular maintenance tasks:
* Clean tracks and components
* Check signal mechanisms
* Verify switch operation
* Test train movement
* Inspect magnetic components

## Troubleshooting

Common assembly issues and solutions:

### Track Problems
* Misaligned sections: Check template positioning
* Rough movement: Clean and lubricate
* Loose components: Secure with appropriate adhesive

### Signal Issues
* Stuck color blocks: Check for debris
* Loose indicators: Tighten mounting
* Poor visibility: Clean and adjust

### Switch Problems
* Binding movement: Check alignment
* Loose locking: Adjust mechanism
* Rough operation: Clean and lubricate

### Train Issues
* Poor movement: Check wheel alignment
* Weak coupling: Verify magnet strength
* Derailments: Check track alignment

## Next Steps

After completing assembly:
1. Review the [Gameplay Rules](../gameplay/rules.md)
2. Set up your first scenario
3. Begin learning the system
